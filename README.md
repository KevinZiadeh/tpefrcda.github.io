# Website for mt TPE (travaux personnels encadrÃ©s)
> Website used as a support for a presentation about the topic: Can we measure love, pain, fear, and intelligence? https://kevinziadeh.github.io/tpefrcda.github.io/

TPE require a presentation of 20 minutes on some chosen topic. I created this website as support material to host my team's work as well as keep our work easily accessible.
